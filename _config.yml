  Hello! I'm Sirena, a Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) student at the University of Iowa, with a focus area in Big Data/Machine Learning and set to graduate in May 2024.
  My technical experience spans a broad range of programming languages including Java, Python, C++, and web technologies such as React, Node.js, and Django.
  I am interested in utilizing machine learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow to solve real-world problems.
  Currently, I'm leading the development of an IoT-enhanced surveillance system for my senior capstone project, which integrates real-time recognition and machine learning algorithms for enhanced security monitoring.
  My GitHub portfolio (sbackham) showcases a range of projects from AI-assisted music generation applications to advanced web-enabled IoT systems, showing my passion for continuous learning and application of broad technologies.
  See those below in my projects section.
  Thanks for reading!
