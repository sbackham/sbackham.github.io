  I'm a full stack developer with a strong focus on front-end engineering, passionate about building intuitive, user-centered web applications. I earned my degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Iowa, where I concentrated in Big Data and Machine Learning.

  Professionally, I’ve worked on enterprise-scale applications using Angular (v15–19), .NET, and SQL, building tools and features for internal teams in the logistics industry. I enjoy developing clean, responsive UIs while also diving into backend development when needed. My experience includes building RESTful APIs, improving application performance with Docker, and integrating third-party services like Google Maps and AWS Bedrock for AI-enhanced features.

  I’m comfortable working across the stack with technologies like TypeScript, Python, Express, Node.js, Firebase, and multithreaded systems. I also regularly use tools like GitHub, Docker, Figma, and CI/CD pipelines to collaborate and ship code efficiently.

  Outside of tech, I enjoy gaming, cooking, traveling, scenic hikes, arts and crafts, and relaxing at home with my cat. Thanks for reading!
